<img align="right" src="freamon.jpg"> Freamon automatically computes GDPR-related and fairness-related metrics over native ML pipelines in Python written with pandas, sklearn and keras. 


### Example pipelines

 * Three complex pipelines on three datasets with multiple input relations from the [arguseyes](https://github.com/schelterlabs/arguseyes)/[mlinspect](https://github.com/stefan-grafberger/mlinspect) projects 
 * Six pipelines on four datasets from the [datascope](https://github.com/DS3Lab/datascope-pipelines) project of the [DS3Lab](https://github.com/DS3Lab)
 * Twelve pipelines on four datasets from the [OpenML](https://www.openml.org) project (based on the flows 5055, 8774, 17315, 17326, 17337, 17355, 17400, 18922, 17496, 18720, 18576, 17655, 17322; and the datasets 44, 246, 823, 1461)
